# Organizational Unit & User Account Design

## Objective
  We are going to design a logical AD structure that reflects a real-world corporate enviroment. This includes creating Organizational Units (OU), user accounts, and security groups in our domain.

#### What is Organizational Units?
They are container objects that allow you to organize and manage network resources, uers, computers and other objects. It would be a nightmare to manage several users and resources without OUs.
  A Well-structured OU hierarchy improves policy management, simplified delegation of control and easier user and group management.
